    1. It reads the
    org.openoffice.Office.Impress/MultiPaneGUI/Framework/ResourceFactories
    configuration data that maps from resource URLs to service names of
    factories that can create resources for the URLs.  When the
    configuration controller wants to create a resource for which it does
    not have a factory, it asks the ModuleController to provide one.  The
    ModuleController looks up the service name registered for the URL of the
    resource and instantiates this service.  The service is expected to
    register on its creation a factory for the resource in question.

    2. The ModuleController instantiates PresentationFactoryProvider.
    This service
    can then register as listeners at the ConfigurationController or do
    whatever they like.
