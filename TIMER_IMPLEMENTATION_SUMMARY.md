# Timer Implementation Summary

## Files Updated for Timer Feature

### Core Timer Implementation (sfx2)
- `include/sfx2/DocumentTimer.hxx` - Timer class header with SfxListener
- `sfx2/source/view/DocumentTimer.cxx` - Timer implementation with auto-save on document events
- `sfx2/Library_sfx.mk` - Build configuration to include DocumentTimer
- `include/sfx2/sfxsids.hrc` - Added SID_DOC_TIMER definition

### Writer (sw)
- `sw/inc/view.hxx` - Added timer member to SwView
- `sw/source/uibase/uiview/view.cxx` - Initialize timer in constructor
- `sw/source/uibase/uiview/view2.cxx` - Handle GetState and Execute for timer
- `sw/uiconfig/swriter/statusbar/statusbar.xml` - Added timer to status bar
- `sw/sdi/swriter.sdi` - Added StateDocTimer command mapping (already existed)

### Calc (sc)
- `sc/source/ui/inc/tabvwsh.hxx` - Added timer member to ScTabViewShell
- `sc/source/ui/view/tabvwsh4.cxx` - Initialize timer in constructor
- `sc/source/ui/view/tabvwsha.cxx` - Handle GetState for timer display
- `sc/source/ui/view/tabvwsh3.cxx` - Handle Execute for timer clicks
- `sc/uiconfig/scalc/statusbar/statusbar.xml` - Added timer to status bar
- **`sc/sdi/scalc.sdi` - Added StateDocTimer SID_DOC_TIMER command mapping**

### Impress/Draw (sd)
- `sd/source/ui/inc/ViewShell.hxx` - Added timer member to base ViewShell
- `sd/source/ui/view/viewshel.cxx` - Initialize timer with ViewShellBase
- `sd/source/ui/view/drviews7.cxx` - Handle GetState and Execute in DrawViewShell
- `sd/uiconfig/simpress/statusbar/statusbar.xml` - Added timer to Impress status bar
- `sd/uiconfig/sdraw/statusbar/statusbar.xml` - Added timer to Draw status bar
- **`sd/sdi/sdraw.sdi` - Added StateDocTimer SID_DOC_TIMER command mapping**

## Key Issues Fixed

1. **Missing UNO Command Mappings**: Calc and Impress/Draw were missing the `StateDocTimer` command in their SDI files. This prevented the status bar from finding the command handler.

2. **Architecture Differences**: 
   - Writer: SwView inherits from SfxViewShell directly
   - Calc: ScTabViewShell inherits from SfxViewShell directly
   - Impress/Draw: ViewShell inherits from SfxShell, so we pass ViewShellBase (which is SfxViewShell)

3. **Event Handling**: Modified DocumentTimer to inherit from SfxListener and listen for save events (SaveDocDone, SaveAsDocDone, SaveToDocDone) to automatically save timer data.

## Build Requirements

After updating SDI files, the build system needs to regenerate the slot files. The SDI compiler processes these files to create the proper command mappings between UNO commands and C++ slot IDs.
