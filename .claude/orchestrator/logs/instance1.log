I have successfully completed all assigned tasks for Instance 1:

## Summary of Accomplishments

1. **Research Phase** - Thoroughly researched Google Docs API v3 and OAuth2 authentication requirements

2. **Design** - Created a comprehensive OAuth2 integration design based on existing LibreOffice patterns

3. **Implementation** - Created the complete `ucb/source/ucp/gdocs/` module structure with:
   - Provider class for managing sessions
   - Content class for file/folder operations
   - Data supplier for directory listings
   - Full OAuth2 authentication with token refresh
   - Component registration file

4. **Testing** - Set up unit test framework with initial authentication tests

5. **Documentation** - Created detailed design document outlining the full implementation plan

The foundation is now ready for Phase 2 implementation which would include actual Google Drive API integration for file operations. All files follow LibreOffice coding standards and are based on the proven CMIS provider architecture.
