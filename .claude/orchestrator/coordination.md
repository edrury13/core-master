# LibreOffice Google Docs Integration - Orchestration Plan

## Active Instances Status
| Instance | Task | Status | Started | Module/Files |
|----------|------|--------|---------|--------------|
| Instance-1 | Google Docs API Research & OAuth2 | Not Started | - | ucb/source/ucp/gdocs/ |
| Instance-2 | DOCX Improvements Analysis | Not Started | - | sw/source/writerfilter/ |
| Instance-3 | PPTX Improvements Analysis | Not Started | - | oox/source/ppt/ |

## Coordination Rules
1. Each instance works on separate modules to avoid conflicts
2. Instances must check in status every 30 minutes
