You are Instance 1 working on LibreOffice Google Docs integration.

IMPORTANT: You are working on a real implementation task. Please actually create the files and implement the code.

Your specific tasks:
1. Create the directory structure at ucb/source/ucp/gdocs/
2. Implement these files based on the CMIS provider template:
   - gdocs_provider.hxx and .cxx - Main provider class
   - gdocs_content.hxx and .cxx - Content handling for files/folders
   - gdocs_datasupplier.hxx and .cxx - Data supplier for listings
   - gdocs_auth.hxx and .cxx - OAuth2 authentication
   - ucpgdocs1.component - Component registration

3. Key implementation points:
   - Base the structure on ucb/source/ucp/cmis/
   - Implement OAuth2 flow for Google authentication
   - Add Google Drive API endpoint definitions
   - Create unit test structure in ucb/qa/cppunit/gdocs/

4. After implementation, create a status report at .claude/orchestrator/status/instance1_complete.md

Start implementing now. Focus on creating working code that compiles with LibreOffice.
