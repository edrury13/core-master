Instance 2: DOCX Handling Improvements - In Progress

Current Tasks:
1. Fix style inheritance in StyleSheetTable.cxx ✓ (Complete)
2. Improve table borders in TablePropertiesHandler.cxx ✓ (Partially Complete)
3. Add content controls in SdtHelper.cxx ✓ (Partially Complete)

Progress:
- Enhanced StyleSheetTable to track style inheritance with m_bHasInheritance flag
- Modified basedOn handling to mark styles with inheritance
- Double/triple borders already supported (codes 3 and 10 in ConversionHelper)
- Cell gradient shading requires adding gradient support to drawing::FillStyle
- Checkbox control implementation added

Completed:
1. StyleSheetTable.cxx improvements:
   - Added m_bHasInheritance member to StyleSheetEntry class
   - Updated constructor to initialize the new member
   - Modified basedOn case to set inheritance flag for better theme color support

2. TablePropertiesHandler.cxx analysis:
   - Confirmed double/triple borders already supported
   - CellColorHandler handles solid colors and patterns
   - Gradient support would require FillStyle_GRADIENT implementation

3. SdtHelper.cxx improvements:
   - Added createCheckboxControl() method
   - Implemented checkbox content control creation
   - Supports checked/unchecked states and custom text
   - Integrates with existing SDT property handling

Summary:
- Style inheritance tracking improved for theme colors
- Table borders already support double/triple styles
- Checkbox content controls now implemented
- Dropdown and date picker controls already exist
- Gradient shading would require deeper changes to FillStyle enum
